These tests can be run via

symata> Tests()

or

julia> Symata.run_testsuite()

sjruntests.jl runs tests using Symata itself.  The files (we choose
suffix sj, but it does not matter) are read as Symata code.

One reason we do the tests in Symata is that we preprocess the Symata code
(as a string) before calling Julia 'parse' on them. Thus, they are not valid Julia
code and Julia macros will not understand them.

Lines beginning with "T " and a new expression are required to return 'true'.
This syntax "T ", is not part of Symata, but is particular to the test code.

These test files were translated from the ../test directory with the script
convtosj.pl. Some were further edited a bit by hand.

For now, the original Julia tests in ../test should still pass.
