* This code and tests work:
include("PatRule.jl")
include("patrule_test_eval.jl")

But, I don't want to touch it any more

* I just wrote mxpr.jl, which uses a different
approach. I want to port the patterns and rules
to this newer code.

* mpatrule.jl (and MPatRule.jl) are copies of the old code,
 but I use type aliases everywhere for Expr. The hope is I can
 drop in for Mxpr.
